# SML-310

This project creates a set of statistical models that can predict turnout for the Texas statewide primary elections (Gubernatorial and Senate races) in 2018, on the county level. 

It is broken up into 3 main folders:
1. Data-Retrieval
This folder contains code for retrieving census data, cleaning and merging it with election data, and conducting some EDA.

2. Validation-Testing
This folder has scripts for conducting validation testing on 3 types of models, full linear regression, a simplified linear regression with fewer variables, and random forest, for both Democratic and Republican primary models.

3. Testing
This folder tests the models on the 2018 senatorial and gubernatorial primaries.

Please see the slideshow for a more complete summary.
